	/// <para>The Deque class implements a type of list known as a Double Ended Queue. A Deque
	/// is quite similar to a List, in that items have indices (starting at 0), and the item at any
	/// index can be efficiently retrieved. The difference between a List and a Deque lies in the
	/// efficiency of inserting elements at the beginning. In a List, items can be efficiently added
	/// to the end, but inserting an item at the beginning of the List is slow, taking time 
	/// proportional to the size of the List. In a Deque, items can be added to the beginning 
	/// or end equally efficiently, regardless of the number of items in the Deque. As a trade-off
	/// for this increased flexibility, Deque is somewhat slower than List (but still constant time) when
	/// being indexed to get or retrieve elements. </para>
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>The Deque class can also be used as a more flexible alternative to the Queue 
	/// and Stack classes. Deque is as efficient as Queue and Stack for adding or removing items, 
	/// but is more flexible: it allows access
	/// to all items in the queue, and allows adding or removing from either end.</para>
	/// <para>Deque is implemented as a ring buffer, which is grown as necessary. The size
	/// of the buffer is doubled whenever the existing capacity is too small to hold all the
	/// elements.</para>
